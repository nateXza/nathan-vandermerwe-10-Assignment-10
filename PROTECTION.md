# Branch Protection Rules

This document explains the branch protection rules implemented for the main branch of this repository.

## Protection Rules

1. **Require Pull Request Reviews**
   - At least one approval is required before merging
   - Ensures code quality through peer review
   - Prevents accidental or malicious changes

2. **Require Status Checks to Pass**
   - All CI/CD checks must pass before merging
   - Includes:
     - Unit tests
     - Integration tests
     - Code coverage requirements
   - Ensures code quality and prevents regressions

3. **No Direct Pushes to Main**
   - All changes must go through pull requests
   - Enforces code review process
   - Maintains a clean git history

## Why These Rules Matter

1. **Code Quality**
   - Peer reviews catch bugs and improve code quality
   - Automated tests ensure functionality
   - Consistent coding standards are maintained

2. **Security**
   - Prevents unauthorized changes
   - Reduces risk of malicious code
   - Maintains audit trail of changes

3. **Collaboration**
   - Encourages team communication
   - Shares knowledge across team members
   - Improves code maintainability

4. **Stability**
   - Prevents breaking changes
   - Maintains production stability
   - Reduces deployment risks

## How to Work with Protected Branches

1. Create a feature branch from main
2. Make your changes
3. Push to your feature branch
4. Create a pull request
5. Wait for reviews and CI checks
6. Merge only after all requirements are met
