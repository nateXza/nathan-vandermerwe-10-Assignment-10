## About the Project
This project implements a system for crop disease detection using Python. The system includes class implementations and all six creational design patterns.

## Language Choice
Python was chosen for its simplicity, readability, and extensive support for object-oriented programming. Libraries like `unittest` make testing straightforward.

## Design Decisions
- **Simple Factory**: Used for centralized image creation.
- **Builder**: Used for constructing complex objects like `Pizza`.
- **Singleton**: Ensures only one instance of `DatabaseConnection`.

## Creational Patterns
Implemented patterns include:
- Simple Factory
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Singleton
